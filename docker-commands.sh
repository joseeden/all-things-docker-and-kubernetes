# This will run an image from a container.
docker run <image>

# As example, this will run an nginx container. 
# Docker will look in the host for the image, and if not found, will check dockerhub na dpull image down.
# Note that this is only done first time. For subsequest executions, the same image pulled down will be re-used.
docker run nginx

# This list all running containers.
# Each container will get a random 'silly name' assigned to it. 
# This is found in the last column of the output.
docker ps

# This list all running and not running containers.
# This also shows the state, 
# if not running - "Exited"
# if running - "Up"
docker ps -a

# Recall that each container will have their own "silly-names".
# You can set your own contianer-name by using the "--name" flag
sudo docker run --name Thanos_of_2019 docker/whalesay cowsay Im-Inevitable! 

# You can also specify the version of image to run in case
# you have multiple versions of an image by specifying "image:version"
# This is called the TAG.
# In this example, we'll pull down two versions of nginx.
sudo docker nginx
sudo docker nginx:1.14-alpine
# To run a container from the 1.14-alpine image and

# You can run multiple isntances/containers from the same image
sudo docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Infinity-and-beyond!

sudo docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Cowabunga!
# This will show three running containers when you list them.

# NOTE that containers are not meant to run operating systems
# Container are meant to run a specific task or process.
# Once task is complete, the container exits.
# The container runs as logn as the process inside it is alive.
# When you run ubuntu, you're just running a base-image of an OS.
# There is no application/process running in it by default.
sudo docker run ubuntu

# You can instruct a process to run by appending the command.
# IN this case, we're telling ubuntu to sleep for 60 seconds.
# This will appear as a running process for a minute when we run docker ps
# After that, container will exit.
sudo docker run ubuntu <command>

# ATTACH MODE
# You can run a container is an ATTACH mode - this means process will run in the foreground.
# you cannot do anything else while process is attached to the console until container exits.
# Console won't response to any input, except if you stop it by running Ctrl-C

# As an example, we can run a simple web-server that listens on port 8080
sudo docker run kodekloud/simple-webapp
